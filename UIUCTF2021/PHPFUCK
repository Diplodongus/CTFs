## Summary
Flag is found within the “flag.php” file on the website. (View Source)

## Flag
```
uiuctf{pl3as3_n0_m0rE_pHpee}
```

## Detailed solution
Connecting to their website, we can see this website is running PHP Version 7.4.3.

 

Furthermore, it is commented at the top that “Flag is inside ./flag.php”

When we try to add /flag.php, we just see “No flag for you!”

 

If we inspect the source of this page (**CTRL+U**), we are greeted with the flag.
